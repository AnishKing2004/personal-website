			<h1>Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Anish, and I'm excited to share a little bit about myself with you.</h1>

			<h2>
				I am a CS Student at University of Portland, passionate about Technology. With 4 years of experience working computers and programming, I have honed my skills and developed a deep understanding of the Computer Science Field.
			</h2>

			<h3>
				Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with diffrent companies such as NVDIA, where I negotiated a contract for gaming computers for the University of Portland Esports CLub. These experiences have shaped me into a creative and detail-oriented professional who is committed to delivering exceptional service.

As an avid gamer, I love diving into virtual worlds, solving puzzles, and competing with fellow gamers. Gaming not only challenges me mentally but also serves as a source of happiness and relaxation.
